# Small tasks ledger

A holding pen for small, non-urgent improvements the developer wants done
*eventually*. These are **not** milestone-blocking on their own — they are
nice-to-haves that get **revisited at the end of every milestone**, before
release, and each open item is weighed for inclusion in that release.

Workflow:
- Add items here as they come up, newest anywhere in **Open**.
- At each milestone's end (before release), review every **Open** item with the
  developer for possible inclusion.
- When an item ships, move it to **Shipped** with the milestone that included it.

## Open

- [ ] **Re-share correctly instead of inlining on overview save.** Overview column
  edits currently inline every `Shared`/`Ref` before encoding to avoid dangling
  refs (`RefBeforeStore`), which produces a valid but ~1.5x larger file that no
  longer matches what the EVE client would write. Revisit: re-derive a correct
  canonical `Shared`/`Ref` numbering after edits (encoder-side auto-dedup, sharing
  structurally-equal values in emit order) so the saved file matches the client's
  dedup. _Added 2026-07-16 (M3c)._

- [ ] **Verify (or migrate) legacy overview editing.** The legacy `tabsettings`
  overview format was never live-tested by the developer. Confirm editing works on
  a real legacy file; simplest safe option may be to upgrade a legacy file to the
  modern `tabsettings_new` shape when it's edited. _Added 2026-07-16 (M3c)._

- [ ] **Resize layout windows from any corner.** In the layout canvas, a
  selected window can only be resized from the bottom-right handle today. Add
  resize handles on all four corners (edges optional) once a window is selected,
  so it can be resized from any corner. _Added 2026-07-15._

- [ ] **Collapsible side panels.** Make the side panels (sidebar file list and
  backups panel) retractable/collapsible so the center pane can grow — useful
  when editing window placements on the layout canvas, which wants as much
  horizontal room as possible. _Added 2026-07-15._

## Shipped

### M3

- [x] **Keep the Save button reachable on small windows.** The filebar now wraps
  and the filename ellipsises, so a narrow/short window no longer pushes Save out
  of view. _Added 2026-07-16 (M3c)._

- [x] **Group the file list by type (character vs account).** The sidebar file
  list is split into Characters / Accounts / Other sections. _Added 2026-07-16 (M3c)._

- [x] **Drop the recent-sibling-writes save warning.** Removed the warning, the
  `SaveReport` field, and the sibling-mtime scan. _Added 2026-07-16 (M3c)._

- [x] **Negative-cache invalid character IDs.** ESI 404s any ID it can't
  resolve; those IDs are never cached, so every launch re-bisects them (extra
  ESI requests, counting against the error limit). Cache a tombstone for
  known-invalid IDs so they're skipped until a manual refresh. _Added
  2026-07-15 (M3a)._

- [x] **Name dialog-opened char files.** The open-file header only shows a
  character name for files discovered by the standard scan; a `core_char_<id>.dat`
  opened via the "Open file…" dialog shows a bare filename. Resolve its name on
  open too. _Added 2026-07-15 (M3a)._

- [x] **Extend name display to more surfaces.** Character names currently show
  in the sidebar and the open-file header only. Add them to the backups panel
  and the native OS window title. _Added 2026-07-15 (M3a)._
